NC NEWS

-Wesbite Link- https://nc-news-fred-reed-fe-project.netlify.app/

-Backend API link- https://github.com/FredR0101/nc_news

This app is a mock build of a news website, with various articles that link to my backend API which I also created. It allows a user to browse articles and sort said articles for ease of location. It also allows a user to log in through a users page, which ultimately allows them to access their own accounts comments on posts through user authentification. A user can add their own comments and upvote or downvote any article they please.

There is error handling implemented specific to circumstances on searching in the URL, that will return error specific codes and messages.
